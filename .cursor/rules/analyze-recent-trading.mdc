# Analyze Recent Trading

When the user says **"analyze recent trading"**, **"run trading analysis"**, **"review recent trading"**, or **"how's the bot doing?"** (in trading context):

1. **Follow the routine:** Read and execute the steps in **`docs/ROUTINE_ANALYZE_RECENT_TRADING.md`**.
2. **Fetch logs:** Run `./scripts/fetch_recent_trading_logs.sh 3000` from the repo root (uses SSH to production; same config as deploy).
3. **Summarize:** Parse the output sections (CYCLE_SUMMARY, Auction, Risk sizing binding constraint, Trade approved/rejected, Utilisation boost, Errors, Critical, INVARIANT/HALT) and produce the short report described in the routine.
4. **Recommendations:** Only if something actionable (e.g. binding constraint mostly `min_notional_reject`, or repeated errors).

The routine and script paths are the single source of truth; this rule only triggers the behaviour.
