# Trading System Context

- **What this is:** Python live trading system (Kraken futures). Real capital at risk. Production runtime: `python -m src.entrypoints.prod_live` → LiveTrading; deployed on a Droplet via systemd (`trading-bot.service`).
- **Key docs:** `FORAI.md` (lessons, architecture, deploy commands), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (components, deploy sequence), `docs/PRODUCTION_RUNTIME.md` (canonical entrypoints). Use them when working on execution, risk, live, or deployment.
- **Safety:** Risk/execution code affects position sizing, margin caps, and order placement. Prefer invariant-preserving changes; run relevant tests after editing `src/risk/*`, `src/execution/*`, `src/live/protection_ops.py`.
- **Deploy:** `make deploy` or `./scripts/deploy.sh` (commit, push, SSH pull, restart). Before suggesting deploy, run unit tests for changed areas or remind to run `make smoke` if `.env.local` exists.
